# Disable Google Lens

![Disable Google Lens](https://i.jollo.org/93zaVjSJ.png)

This extension redirects *Google Lens* results to the normal image results.

Works as a standalone extension or with [Google Images Restored](https://github.com/fanfare/googleimagesrestored).

Note: on Chrome, the right click menu option will still say "*Search image with Google Lens*", but the end result will be like how it used to be.

## Installation

This extension is available as a [Firefox Add-On](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disablegooglelens/).

On Chrome, the [latest version](https://github.com/fanfare/disablegooglelens/releases/download/0.0.1/disable-google-lens_manifest_v3_chrome-0.0.1.zip) can be loaded as an unpacked extension.
