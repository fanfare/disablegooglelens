# Disable Google Lens

![Disable Google Lens](https://i.jollo.org/93zaVjSJ.png)

This extension redirects *Google Lens* results to the normal image results.

Works as a standalone extension or with [Google Images Restored](https://github.com/fanfare/googleimagesrestored).

Note: on Chrome, the right click menu option will still say "Search image with Google Lens", but the end result will be like how it used to be.

## Installation
