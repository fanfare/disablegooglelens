# Disable Google Lens

![Disable Google Lens](https://i.jollo.org/93zaVjSJ.png)

This extension redirects *Google Lens* results to the normal image results.

Works as a standalone extension or with [Google Images Restored](https://github.com/fanfare/googleimagesrestored) (which hides the side panel on *Google Images* entirely).

Note: in Chromium, the right click menu option will still say "Search image with Google Lens", but the end result will be like how it used to be.

## Installation

The extension is available for [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-google-lens/dkapjhgpncbeiebegegdbpgfoabdkilh).

It is also available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disablegooglelens/).

Regular Chrome users: there was an update to Chrome that caused the Google Lens results to appear in a side panel on the right side of the screen. While this extension *will* redirect those results (inside the side panel) to the normal version, the loading of the results in a side panel is terrible. I'm investigating the possibility of some kind of fix. In the mean time, there is a seperate extension called [Search by Image on Google](https://github.com/Sukigu/search-by-image-on-google) (not mine) that restores the old "search by image" functionality in the context menu specifically, if you need to search by image in the context menu.
